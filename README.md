# Assignment Two
Imagine having made 95k USD as your gross income, although as for your tax return, you have to pay 4% of your money for your estate tax, as well as 2% of your money for the county tax. This is the assignment.

## How to run it?
### Using Visual Studio 2022 and Windows.
1. Simply click on code and click on `Open with Visual Studio`

2. There should simply be a pop-up on the top that reads `Allow this site to open the git-client link with Microsoft Visual Studio Web Protocol Handler Selector?`

3. Click allow and you should be able to open the project with ease.

4. This should bring you here (because I made the project, it'll give me the error that the path already exists, you shouldn't worry about this)

5. Click on clone and you should be able to run the project by just clicking this button on the top
