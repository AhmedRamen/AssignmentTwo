# Assignment One
This assignment is about swapping two integers so they both match the variable names.

## How to run it?

2. There should simply be a pop-up on the top that reads `Allow this site to open the git-client link with Microsoft Visual Studio Web Protocol Handler Selector?`

3. Click allow and you should be able to open the project with ease.

4. This should bring you here (because I made the project, it'll give me the error that the path already exists, you shouldn't worry about this)

5. Click on clone and you should be able to run the project by just clicking this button on the top

6. If all done correctly, it should print this in the output:

```
Before swap:
The two variable: 1
The one variable: 2

Normal (Before swap):
The one variable: 2
The two variable: 1

After swap:
The two variable: 2
The one variable: 1

Normal (After swap):
The one variable: 1
The two variable: 2
```
